## Overview

Slay the Dragon is a side-scrolling game in which the player follows the Hero's Path to slay the dragon in it's lair.  The player is joined by Hero NPCs whose only purpose is to slay the dragon (and fail, but in doing so make the dragon harder to take down).  The player (and each Hero) can only hold one item at a time (weapon, food, gold), so getting a Hero NPC to drop its weapon in favor of another item is the intended strategy for stopping them from attacking the dragon.   Alternative strategies include killing the Heroes (which eventually makes them target the player) or blocking their path to the dragon's lair (since Heroes are not as smart as the player, and may fall into pits or get confused by fallen trees).
